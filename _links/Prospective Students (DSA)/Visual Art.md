<h4><strong>DSA Visual Art</strong></h4>
<p>The Visual Art programme in Orchid Park Secondary School aims to develop an artist in every child. Through reaching out to the community and engaging in various community projects such as producing art pieces as corporate gifts, fund-raising and beautifying the school environment, the club hopes to foster a strong sense of belonging as well as develop positive values in all members. </p>
<p>All students enrolled through DSA Visual Arts will be members of the CCA, Art Club. They are expected to remain in the Art Club throughout their secondary education with OPSS.</p>
<p>Being an Enhance Art Programme school, selected DSA students (students offered Art at Upper Sec as an elective) will participate in special projects organised by the Arts Education Branch, Student Development Curriculum Division, MOE. These students will be given extra opportunities to participate in the annual Incubation Lab project (ILEAP) that is organized every November. </p>
