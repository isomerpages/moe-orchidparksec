<h4><strong>DSA Performing Arts</strong></h4>
<p>The CCA programme in Orchid Park Secondary School provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Each CCA is guided by a CCA Student Development Plan which is designed towards progressive development and attainment of CCA learning outcomes.</p>
<p>Performing Arts instil in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of the different Arts genre in our multi-racial society. </p>
<p>Orchid Park Secondary School invites all current Primary Six Students (or equivalent) to apply for admission to our school through DSA in the following categories:</p>
