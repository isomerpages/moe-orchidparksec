<h4>About the CCA</h4>

<p>The Art Club was started in 2002 in Orchid Park Secondary School to cultivate a love and appreciation for the visual arts in every member of the club. We aim to reach out to the community by engaging in various community projects. The Art club members are also tasked to produce art pieces as corporate gifts, for fund-raising as well as to beautify the school environment. Through the weekly sessions of fun-filled activities, we hope to foster a strong sense of belonging as well as develop positive values in all members.</p>
