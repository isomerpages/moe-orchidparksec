<h4>About the CCA</h4>
<p>OPSS Guitar Ensemble was established in 2008 and has matured under the guidance of our team of dedicated instructors and teachers. The Ensemble has grown in number and there are currently more than seventy members.</p>
<p>The Ensemble plays music ranging from classical to traditional folk music. In order to do that, students are taught how to read music as well as guitar skills to create beautiful music together. The Ensemble aims to develop leadership, teamwork, self-discipline and creativity in the students through music.</p>
<p>Besides participating in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Instrumental Ensemble biennially, the Ensemble also performs at school events such as Arts Panaches, Secondary One Orientation, Chinese New Year, Teachers&rsquo; Day and Speech Day.</p>
