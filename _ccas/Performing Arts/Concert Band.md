<h4>About the CCA</h4>
<p><strong>Orchid Park Concert Band&nbsp;</strong>previously&nbsp;known as<strong>&nbsp;Wind Orchestra&nbsp;</strong>was founded in 1999 as an initiative from Orchid Park Secondary School to gather musically keen and inclined students to make music. Originally conceived as a Marching Band, the Band later took on the form of a Wind Orchestra and was renamed in 2005 to reflect our change in musical direction and our commitment towards performing serious wind literature and advocating works of local composers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Orchestra, though tender in age, has performed at various school and national functions, as well as collaborating with many local Wind Bands in musical exchanges; helping us foster a closer relationship and partnership in music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Orchestra also stages a series of concerts annually since 2002 &ndash; mainly&nbsp;<strong>Alla Marziale and OP. Concert</strong>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>Alla Marziale&nbsp;</strong>series is our family concerts where families of our musicians are highly encouraged to attend to understand the culture of the Orchestra. The<strong>OP.&nbsp;</strong>(Opus) series showcases serious wind works and literature, where they inspire the musicians to break away from the norms and look at music from a different perspective. These concerts are instrumental in developing our musicians&rsquo; musicianship and gradually developing their personalities, characters and leadership skills in the learning process.</p>
