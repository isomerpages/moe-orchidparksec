<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) And Student Well-Being</p>
<p>In Orchid Park Secondary School, the Character and Citizenship development is delivered via a whole school approach and it is inherent in all aspects of school life (CCE Lessons, assembly programmes, Service Learning or Values in action (VIA) projects, preventive programmes, CCAs and instructional programme). We actively seek partnership with the community, parents and various agencies to organise programmes and activities that engage and empower our students to excel.</p>
<p>Our vision is to develop students of good character, who actively volunteers for the betterment of the community, and who are proud to be Singaporean.</p>
<p>Our teachers are guided by the three "Every"s. We believe that "Every&nbsp;students&nbsp;is a student of mine", "Every student deserves our best" and "Every&nbsp;students&nbsp;deserves opportunities to succeed".</p>
