<h4>About the CCA</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Girls&rsquo; Brigade Singapore (GBS)</strong> is a Uniformed Youth Organisation for girls. GBS is an associate member of the National Council of Social Service and was registered as a Charity under the Charities Act, 1982 since 23 April 1985. GBS is registered as an Institution of Public Character (IPC) under the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Girls&rsquo; Brigade in OPSS aims to develop every member to discover their fullest potential. Our badge work program provides opportunities for girls to discover varied interests. By providing girls with leadership opportunities, our hope is that they will develop not just as leaders, but eventually servant leaders who are willing to serve their peers and the wider community. We also hope that girls will develop lifelong friendships and bonds here in 47 th COY.</p>
