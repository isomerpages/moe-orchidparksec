<h4><strong>VISION</strong></h4>
<p>The National Police Cadet Corps is to become the best youth organisation in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world.</p>
<h4><strong>MISSION</strong></h4>
<p>The National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.</p>
<h4>About the CCA</h4>
<p>Founded as the Police Cadet Corps in 1959, the youth organisation took on its current name only in 1971. As an organisation that firmly believes in development of character, leadership and resilience, training has evolved from just drills to more structured and interesting training programs. Through a myriad of activities, values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness are inculcated to develop members into Caring and Responsible Citizens.</p>
