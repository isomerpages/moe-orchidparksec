<p>The *Visual Art programme in Orchid Park Secondary School aims to develop an artist in every child. Through reaching out to the community and engaging in various community projects such as producing art pieces as corporate gifts, fund-raising and beautifying the school environment, the club hopes to foster a strong sense of belonging as well as develop positive values in all members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All students enrolled through DSA Visual Arts will be members of the *CCA, Art Club. They are expected to remain in the Art Club throughout their secondary education with OPSS.</p>
<p>All DSA students will be required to take Art as an elective subject at national examinations in secondary 4/5. There will be interim review on their progress and their Art results will be closely monitored throughout their 4/5 years in the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All DSA students will participate in special projects and service learning under Art Department&rsquo;s social outreach programme. Being an Enhance Art Proggramme school, all DSA students (at secondary 3) will participate in special projects organised by the Arts Education Branch, Student Development Curriculum Division, MOE. Under EAP, they will be given extra opportunities to participate in the annual Incubation Lab project (ILEAP) that is organized every November.&nbsp;</p>
