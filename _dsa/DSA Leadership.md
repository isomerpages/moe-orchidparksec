<p>In Orchid Park Secondary School, our mission is to nurture and develop every student to become an engaged *leader so that they can lead and serve with compassion.<br />We believe that every student can be nurtured to be a leader to lead themselves and/or others and we desire our Orchidians to achieve the following outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Orchidian with a &lsquo;can do&rsquo; attitude who has initiative and volunteers</li>
<li>An Orchidian with a positive outlook who is able to rally others to work towards set goals</li>
<li>An Orchidian who is resourceful and perceptive</li>
<li>An Orchidian who fosters collaboration and values diverse views</li>
<li>An Orchidian who is compassionate towards their fellow men</li>
</ul>
<p>DSA Leadership is not a CCA. All students enrolled through DSA leadership are&nbsp;expected to take up a CCA. They are expected to serve in the school&rsquo;s student councilthroughout their secondary education with Orchid Park Secondary School.</p>
