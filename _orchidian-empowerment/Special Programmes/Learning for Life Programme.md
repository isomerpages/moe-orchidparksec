<p><strong>Community OutReach Education (CORE)<br></strong>The CORE programme develops our Community Youth Leaders (CYL) to be advocates for causes which they are passionate about. Driven by the school mission to develop students to be resourceful and confident individuals who are compassionate to their fellowmen, CORE works towards building student leadership, particularly through community engagement.<br>Three key theoretical models underpin the design of the curriculum:&nbsp;</p>

<p>At all levels, CORE is undergirded by the FIDS Design Thinking process to equip students with necessary and relevant skills and dispositions to plan and execute meaningful VIA &amp; service learning projects to engage the community.<br>Tier 2 provides experiential learning of the 5 Exemplary Leadership Practices in The Leadership Challenge by Kouzes and Posner. This is in alignment to the school's student leadership framework.<br>Students are trained in Design Thinking and Service Learning methodology and these provide a frame for them to better understand and appreciate the needs of the community so as to initiate, plan and implement student-initiated and organised community engagement projects.</p>

<p>Through CORE, the school seeks to engage and support the community, moving out from its immediate locality to reach out to the larger community, through sustainable and strategic partnerships and collaborations, including Northwest CDC (NWCDC), Nee Soon South CC, KTPH, Yishun Health, Senior Activity Centres etc.<br>Another of our key Tier 2 learning programme is the Tri-generational Home Care project - a partnership with NWCDC, NUS student volunteers and healthcare professionals from KTPH. After having undergone a leadership workshop, students worked with the volunteers and professionals to design activities to provide holistic care to the elderly. The project has been a very rich learning experience for the students and from their reflection, it has propelled them forward as the community youth leaders that the school hopes to grow and nurture.<br>At Tier 3, our CORE leaders continues to be active in the community and returns to guide and inspire our students as Community Youth Leaders.</p>
