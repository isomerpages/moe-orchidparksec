<p>ARTopIA, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in OPSS, is an aesthetics programme that exposes students to various genres of Art, Music, Dance and Drama. The programme hones the students’ skills and deepen their understanding in the areas of the Arts. This programme also engages the students to build their passion in the Arts by empowering them to showcase their skills and talents through workshops, performances, exhibitions, competitions. Notable ARTopIA events includes art workshops and mass dance lessons.</p>

<p>Other programmes designed to encourage students to further pursue their passion for the Arts include the Music unit’s Advanced Music Programme (AMP) which aims to expose and educate students about the local arts and music scene through watching live concerts. This programme is open to students of all levels and streams through interviews conducted by the Music teachers.</p>

<p>In addition to ARTopIA, OPSS also runs the Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) which is an upper secondary art programme that allows students who have interest, artistic potential and passion to pursue a deeper study of art. There is no additional school fee required for the EAP.</p>

<p>EAP students can expect:
<br>a) Exposure to specialised art media, equipment and creative processes.
<br>b) To be equipped with abilities and skills to further their passion for art, design, media and technology.
<br>c) Opportunities to learn from professionals about jobs and practices in the arts and creative industries.
<br>d) Collaborative learning experiences with other EAP students through combined school events and workshops.</p>

<p>In the past few years, students from the EAP have gone on to pursue higher education related to the Arts, including design courses at Nanyang Polytechnic, Fine Arts in the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), and Lasalle College of the Arts.</p>
