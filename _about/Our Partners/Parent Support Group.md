<p><b>About Parent Support Group</b></p>

<p>Many Singapore schools have set up Parent Support Group (PSG) in recent years. Parents who have the child's interest at heart and passionate about providing service can consider joining PSGs. These groups comprise parents who meet regularly and who work with school personnel on programmes and projects that will benefit the students. OPSS PSG plays an active role in supporting school as well as FamilyMatters bonding programmes and parenting talks. Our parents develop a wider network, learn from one another, share experiences and together bring out the best in our students. </p>

<p>Being involved in PSG, we are sending a clear signal to our young adults our concern for them. This will in turn encourage them to adopt positive attitudes towards learning. With our active involvement, our teens will be motivated towards better personal development, have better attendance and tend to participate more actively in learning and other school activities. </p>

<p>With the support of School Leaders, Liaison Teacher, PSG has organised various activities such as Prawning, Nature Walk, Dragonboat, Bowling and many more. We are also involved in school events such as Sec 1 Registration, Cross Country, Career Guidance Day and PAYM National Day Celebration. </p>

<p>We have lined up many more exciting programmes and we look forward to your participation and support. Lastly, OPSS PSG is about family - a community family made up of diverse and vibrant parents from all walks of life and family that comes together to fulfil the mission of nourishing the spirit and well-being of the students, teachers, staff members and fellow parents of Orchid Park Secondary School. </p>
