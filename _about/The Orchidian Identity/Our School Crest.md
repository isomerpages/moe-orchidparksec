<h4>Our School Crest</h4>

<p>At the heart of the school crest is an open book that signifies the school’s vision to nurture empowered learners who are curious and self-directed in their quest for knowledge. <br>
As a symbol of peace and friendship, the olive branches that extend outward from the book represent the compassionate leaders that all Orchidians aspire to be. <br>
The orchid that is encased within a globe at the top of the crest depicts the third and final part of the school’s vision, which is to develop future-ready Orchidians who are equipped with 21<sup>st</sup>-century competencies to take on the world.<br>
The five lines on both sides of the globe represent the five school values of Integrity, Compassion, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility that undergird the school’s educational philosophy of enabling all Orchidians to be the best versions of themselves.</p>
