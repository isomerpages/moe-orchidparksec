<h4><strong>DSA Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>In Orchid Park Secondary School, our mission is to nurture and develop every student to become an engaged leader so that they can lead and serve with compassion.</p>

<p>We believe that every student can be nurtured to be a leader to lead themselves and/or others and we desire our Orchidians to achieve the following outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Orchidian with a ‘can do’ attitude who has initiative and volunteers</li>
<li>An Orchidian with a positive outlook who is able to rally others to work towards set goals</li>
<li>An Orchidian who is resourceful and perceptive</li>
<li>An Orchidian who fosters collaboration and values diverse views</li>
<li>An Orchidian who is compassionate towards their fellow men</li>
</ul>
