<h4>About the CCA</h4>
<p>In hockey, we aim to foster among our boys a love for the game and the correct attitudes to face the challenges of life.</p>
<p>We believe that every child has the potential to excel in the game if they are willing to work hard. We are constantly looking to expose our boys to the game at every level, encouraging them to play train with external clubs and the National teams.</p>
<p>We believe strongly in the development of our student leaders. Potential leaders are given opportunities to display and develop their leadership skills, working independently or in teams, to fulfil the full potential of the team.</p>
