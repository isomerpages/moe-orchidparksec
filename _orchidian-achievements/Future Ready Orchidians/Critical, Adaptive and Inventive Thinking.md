<h4><strong>CAIT in Action!</strong></h4>
<p>At Orchid Park, we firmly believe in equipping our students with the values, knowledge, skills and dispositions to navigate and thrive in the future.</p>

<p>In an increasingly BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, Incomprehensible) world, we empower our students to be adaptable, resilient and critical thinkers.&nbsp; Through our focus on Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking (CAIT), we prepare our students to embrace change, solve complex problems and contribute meaningfully to the community.</p>

<p>CAIT skills enable students to use sound reasoning and critical thinking to inform decision-making, generate novel and useful ideas to address challenges, and manage complexities and ambiguities to adapt to changing situations.</p>
