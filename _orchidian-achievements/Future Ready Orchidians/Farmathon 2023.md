<h3>Farmathon 2023</h3>
<p></p><h4>Background</h4>
Farmathon 2023 is a platform for secondary school students who are passionate about food and sustainability, and have a keenness for entrepreneurship to pitch their business ideas to the industry’s key players like City Sprouts.<br>Each team submits a 1-page proposal and a two-minute video in response to one of the challenge statements set by the organiser. Our team worked on the challenge Statement: <i>In view of the rise of high-tech farms in Singapore, how might we improve the accessibility, affordability and awareness of the produce from these farms?</i><p></p>
	
<p></p><h4>Details</h4>
Students wrote a business proposal, accompanied by a video, to sell their business ideas to the industry’s key player in relation to the challenge statement.<br>On the actual day, students were also given an additional unseen topic which they took about 2 hours to prepare. They were given time to present their business ideas for both the challenge statement as well as the unseen topic. Presentations were assessed by Singapore Food Agency as well as the directors of the various local farms. There was also a Q&amp;A session where they had to address questions posed by the panel of judges.<br>Our Orchidians did extremely well and emerged with a Top 3 placing for the competition.<p></p>
	
<p></p><h5>"Participating in the Farmathon propelled my learning beyond the classroom, prompting innovative solutions to enhance the awareness of high-tech farms and food sustainability. The challenge stirred a flood of ideas, and our team's recognition as one of the top contenders filled me with a sense of accomplishment."</h5><div align="right">Ng Xi Rou, V8<br>2023</div><p></p>
