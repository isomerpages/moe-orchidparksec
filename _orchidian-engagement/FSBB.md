<h4>WHAT IS SUBJECT-BASED BANDING (SECONDARY)?</h4>
<p>Subject-Based Banding (Secondary) [SBB (Sec)] is one of many pathways for students to nurture their aptitudes and enhance their access to opportunities throughout their educational journey. SBB (Sec) allows students to take specific subjects at more demanding level starting from Secondary 1 if they are found suitable to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students in the N(A) or N(T) course may be able to take some subjects at Express and/or N(A) levels to allow them to stretch themselves cognitively and acquire deeper competencies in their area(s) of strengths.</p>
<h4>OFFERING SUBJECTS AT A MORE DEMANDING LEVEL</h4>
<p>Currently, all secondary school students can offer English Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Language at a more demanding level through SBB(Sec) from Secondary 1, if they meet subject-specific criteria. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary 1 is based on students&rsquo; PSLE AL Score for each subject.</p>
<p>Students posted to the N(A) and N(T) course are eligible to take some subjects (English Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages) at a more demanding level starting from Secondary 1, if they have performed well in these subjects at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE):</p>
<ul>
<li>Students posted to the N(A) or N(T) course who scored AL 5 or better for a PSLE Standard subject can take the subject at the Express level; and</li>
<li>Students posted to the N(T) course who scored at least AL 6 for a PSLE Standard subject or A in a PSLE Foundation subject can take it at N(A) level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students posted to the N(A) or N(T) course who do well in school-based examinations may also be considered to offer Humanities subjects (Geography, History, Literature in English) in addition to the above mentioned subjects at more demanding level from Secondary 2, if found suitable to do so by their schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the start of Secondary 1, other N(A) and N(T) students who do well in school-based examinations may be considered to take more demanding level subjects in the next level of study if they are found suitable to do so by the school.</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject levels, G1, G2 and G3, will be mapped from today&rsquo;s N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*Do note that in 2022, OPSS will be FSBB Phase 1 schools<br /></strong><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/main.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/main.html</a></p>
<h4>How does FSBB work?</h4>
<p>With Full SBB in secondary schools, students will have greater flexibility to offer more subjects at different levels that suit their interests, aptitude and learning needs. There will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) courses. Students will be in mixed form classes where they have the opportunities to interact with peers of different strengths and interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Full SBB allows every child access to opportunities, throughout his/her education journey, to develop his/her unique talents and fulfil his/her potential in life.</p>
<p>From 2024, the Express, N(A) and N(T) courses will be removed. Students will take subjects at three subject levels: G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), based on their aptitude for and interest in the subjects.</p>
<p>Students will continue to be posted into secondary schools through three scoring bands, as students&rsquo; PSLE Scores remain a good initial gauge of their overall academic ability and their appropriate subject levels at the beginning of Secondary 1.</p>

<p>Under FSBB, all the subjects students offer are categorized into two groups &ndash; those in the Common Curriculum, and those offered as SBB subjects at different levels.</p>
<p>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.</p>
<p>The Common Curriculum comprises the following subjects which are taught to the entire form class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arts;</li>
<li>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE);</li>
<li>Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T);</li>
<li>Food and Consumer Education (FCE);</li>
<li>Music; and</li>
<li>Physical Education (PE</li>
</ul>
<p>For SBB subjects, students will be grouped in different teaching groups/classes based on the levels at which they take each subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This provides students with a more customised learning experience according to their subject-specific strengths and interests, and empowers students to take greater ownership of their learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>English Language;</li>
<li>Mother Tongue Languages;</li>
<li>Mathematics;</li>
<li>Science;</li>
<li>Geography;</li>
<li>History;</li>
<li>Literature</li>
</ul>
<p>During SBB lessons, students are offered subjects in ability-banded classes &mdash; Express, N(A), and N(T) classes. For FSBB (Sec 1 2022 cohort), they will be in Teaching Groups (G1, G2, G3).</p>
