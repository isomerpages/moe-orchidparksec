<h4>About the Department</h4>
<p>The Craft &amp; Technology (ACT) Department aims to provide Orchidians with a meaningful learning experience that encourages the spirit of innovation and creativity through self-directed learning.</p>
<p>The department consists of four subject units - Art, Design &amp; Technology, Music and Nutrition &amp; Food Science.&nbsp; At the lower secondary level, students will go through a 2-year journey learning interesting concepts, knowledge and skills for each subject at a common level, known as Common Curriculum, to allow them to learn together in their mixed form classes.&nbsp; At the Upper Secondary level, students can choose to pursue one of these subjects as an elective subject at a higher level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will learn about each subject through theoretical lessons, hands-on practical activities and develop life skills through a Coursework component. The programmes that students go through for each subject area are specially designed by the unitsâ€™ teachers to engage students to explore possibilities, enable them to innovate and ultimately empower them to create.</p>
