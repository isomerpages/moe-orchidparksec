<h4>About the Department<br>
Computer Applications Unit</h4>
<p>We strongly believe in self-directed learning and provide platforms for Orchidians to take responsibility for their own learning.Better students are given the autonomy to move around the class as peer coaches to help those in need, identify mistakes and share what they know. At the same time, they are made aware of any blind spots in their knowledge of the lesson.<br>
Learning journeys are also planned to expose students to authentic real-world applications of what is taught in the textbook.</p>
<h4>Elements of Business Skills </h4>
<p>This subject is offered as an elective to upper secondary Normal (Technical) students. The syllabus focuses on three key service industries, namely retail, travel and tourism, and hospitality. It also covers the basic concepts and practices in areas of marketing and customer relations. Job attachments in a hotel are also arranged for authentic learning experiences.</p>
