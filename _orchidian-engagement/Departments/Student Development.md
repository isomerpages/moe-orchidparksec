<h4>**Orchid Park Secondary School Student Development Framework**</h4>
<img src="/images/Departments/SD/sd2.png">
<p>A caring and enabling school environment helps students feel safe, accepted, empowered and competent. It is marked by healthy relationships, care and support among all members of the school. Recognition of student needs and psychosocial factors such as a sense of belonging and autonomy contribute to a caring and enabling school community.<br>
As such, the Student Development department has put in systems to strengthen teacher-student relationships (TSR) and adopted a discipline with care approach which nurtures Orchidians to consider perspectives, make responsible decisions and restore relationships in the school community. The school also utilises a variety of scans to identify student needs and support their holistic development in the six domains: Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, Social, Moral and Aesthetics (PIESMA).<br>
The support programmes in the school promote a culture of care and inclusivity. They aim to strengthen student’s resilient mindsets and supportive networks to ensure physical and psychological safety, through purposeful engagement and positive experiences. They are part of the school’s efforts to develop Future-Ready Orchidians who are confident and optimistic in embracing changes, and able to manage ambiguity.<br>
In Orchid Park Secondary School, character development is delivered via a whole school approach. It is inherent in all aspects of school life; Instructional programmes, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Student Support programmes, Assembly Programmes, CCAs, Cohort camps, Learning Journeys, Overseas Learning trips and Community OutReach Education (CORE) programmes, etc. The multiple platforms help students internalize values, social-emotional competencies, 21st-century competencies and citizenship depositions, empowering Orchidians to be their best so as to become compassionate leaders.
