<h4>About the Department</h4>
<p>The English Language and Literature Department aims to imbue a passion for the English Language and English Literature and to nurture Orchidians to become empathetic communicators, discerning readers and competent writers in a globalised world.<br>
As part of our curriculum, students are given opportunities to inquire, develop their critical thinking skills, share and explore varied perspectives and evaluate different viewpoints. They are also taught to apply a range of learner strategies to regulate their learning and develop their metacognition. Teachers use ICT pervasively in the classroom to facilitate instruction in the classrooms. ICT is also used for Assessment for Learning in the English Language classroom. Apart from the Student Learning Space (SLS), teachers also tap on the suite of Google Application and other applications to deepen and enrich our studentsâ€™ learning. We also nurture the joy of learning and stretch our capable students via oratorical and essay-writing competitions.</p>
