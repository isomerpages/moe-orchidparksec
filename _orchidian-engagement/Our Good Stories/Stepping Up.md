<h4>Marysa (Secondary 3, Vanda-3, 2021)</h4>

<p>"Anytime you have an opportunity to do something good, just take it." This quote is from none other than our very own Marsya from Vanda 4.</p>
	
<p>Since primary school, Marsya has been the beneficiary of the Little Arts Academy and has since progressed to be part of 10 Square Youth, where she has majored in dance and theatre as part of her enrichment. When Marya first started dancing, she did it as she was passionate about it, and it brought her joy. But since then, she has discovered that dancing can bring joy to and benefit others. This realisation occurred when she saw herself in the news, and that was when the ball dropped. Marsya realised that by supporting and dancing for charitable organisations, she could raise funds for others so that they may benefit from programmes offered by philanthropic organisations just the way she had. That was when she understood the significance of her dancing.</p>
	
<p>Spurred on by this newfound sense of purpose, Marsya has continued to dance for charity. She has participated in several ChildAid events in KL, Jakarta and Singapore. ChildAid is Singapore's largest annual children's charity concert. It supports The Straits Times Pocket Money Fund and The Business Times Budding Artists Fund. The former pays for socially disadvantaged school-going children's meals and transport fees, while the latter supports financially underprivileged children's lessons in the performing arts. Apart from supporting the charities that have helped her, Marsya has also encouraged and inspired others to join her in fundraising events.</p>
	
<p>Marsya is undoubtedly a role model for us all. She has reminded us that we should not take things for granted and that no one is ever too young or too old to help someone else. She believes that no matter how small, our actions would always be seen and remembered by others.</p>
	
<p>Well said Marsya!</p>
