<p>Orchid Park Secondary School recently received a heartwarming message from a community member who was deeply impressed by our Student Leaders' efforts at the HOPE in Every Heart Mini-Funfair conducted on 17 May 2025. This Student-led Advocacy Project showcases how our student leaders take ownership in serving the community while inspiring their peers. The spontaneous and genuine appreciation expressed in this email reflects the impact our students have made through their dedication to serving others. We are proud to share this testament to our students' commitment to making a difference:</p>
	
<p>To the incredible students of Orchid Park Secondary School</p>

<p>I wanted to extend my heartfelt praise for the outstanding Saturday morning carnival you organized for the residents! Your event was a breath of fresh air, and I was particularly impressed by the creative range of games you designed—they were inventive, engaging, and far removed from the typical carnival setups run by vendors. It was evident how much thought and effort went into crafting activities that were both fun and meaningful for the community.</p>

<p>What truly stood out, however, was the genuine warmth and enthusiasm you showed while interacting with the residents. You didn't just host games; you built connections, shared laughter, and created a joyful atmosphere that everyone could feel. The fact that this entire project—from planning to execution—was student-led makes it even more remarkable. Sourcing prizes, coordinating resources, and managing logistics independently showcases your teamwork, leadership, and dedication to serving others.</p>

<p>You've set an exemplary standard for what youth-led initiatives can achieve. Your passion, responsibility, and innovative spirit are a model not just for your peers, but for the wider community. Orchid Park Secondary School should be immensely proud of students like you, who turn vision into action and inspire others along the way.</p>

<p>Thank you for reminding us all of the power of young people to make a difference. <br>Keep shining!
<br>With admiration,  
<br>Shah</p>
