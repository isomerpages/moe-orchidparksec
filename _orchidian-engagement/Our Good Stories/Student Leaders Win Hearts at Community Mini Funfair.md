<p>&lt;p&gt;In a remarkable display of civic-mindedness and community spirit,
one of our students, Khasyah Al-Iqram Bin Mohammed Khalif, from Orchis
2, has been recognised for his brave actions in helping to extinguish a
fire in his neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;On the night of 30 November 2024, at approximately 11:15 pm,
Khasyah and his family noticed a green rubbish bin ablaze in the void deck
of their block. Without hesitation, Khasyah, led by his father, Mr Khalif,
sprang into action. They swiftly gathered buckets of water from their flat
and worked together to douse the flames. Thanks to their prompt response
and teamwork, Khasyah and his family successfully extinguished the fire
before the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) arrived at the scene. Their
quick action potentially prevented the fire from spreading and causing
more significant damage, highlighting the crucial role that civic-minded
individuals play in maintaining community safety.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;When asked about his motivation to act, Khasyah simply stated,
"I was worried for my neighbour." Khasyah's actions perfectly embody our
school's core value of compassion and our vision of developing leaders
who care deeply for their community. His quick thinking and selfless response
demonstrate how compassion can translate into decisive action that benefits
others.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;In recognition of their bravery and public-spiritedness, Khasyah
and his siblings were presented with the prestigious Community First Responder
Award. The ceremony took place on 24 January 2025, with Colonel Lim Beng
Hui, Commander of 3rd SCDF Division, personally presenting the awards.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;We are immensely proud of Khasyah for living out our school's
values and vision. His story serves as an inspiration to all students,
showing how compassionate leadership can make a real difference in our
community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p>
