<p>It was an unexpected find for two good friends who were on their way home after a short meet-up on the evening of 24 September. Kenji and Hadith picked up a mobile phone just after leaving a food mall when they were headed to where their bicycles were parked. </p>

<p>The 2 young boys unanimously agreed that they should send it to the nearest police station. When they got to Yishun North Police Station, and were waiting for their turn to lodge a report, the mobile phone rang! The gentleman on the line informed that he was a friend of the phone’s owner, and he was calling on behalf of his friend who had lost the phone.</p>

<p>Later that evening, the mobile phone was returned to its rightful owner at the police station, although the good deed resulted in the duo getting home much later. The owner was tremendously grateful to our young heroes, who did not think that what they had done was extraordinary. Nonetheless, both felt a great sense of satisfaction when they saw the joy in the owner’s face. “We followed our hearts and did what should be done. But it’s surely a great feeling to be of help,” Hadith mused. “Yes! The feeling of satisfaction!” added Kenji.</p>
