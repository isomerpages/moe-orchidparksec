<h4>Animal or Not</h4>

<p>Many of us are too involved with our own lives that we tend to neglect what is happening around us and those that may need help are often ignored. In this story, the ‘person’ in need of help was actually a pigeon and a group of our very own Secondary One students came to save it.
</p>
<p>On the afternoon of 29th June, a group of students, Jorlin Cai (L5), Chen Junxi (L5), Vivian Tan (L2), Ace Fong (L1) were behind Block F when they stumbled upon an injured and blind-in-one-eye pigeon. When they saw the poor bird, they felt compelled to help it. They called out to a teacher, who was passing through, to get help for the injured bird. They consulted the teacher about the bird, the teacher advised them to call the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES).
</p>
<p>They called but ACRES was short of manpower and could not take the bird in. ACRES advised them to continue feeding the bird. The friends agreed that Junxi would take the bird back home as he has a pet bird and does not think his parents would mind him bringing the pigeon home. Junxi continued feeding it with food and water. However, he did not see any improvement in the bird's health, Junxi had to bring it to a veterinary clinic that evening so that the pigeon would get the proper medical treatment. Alas, the veterinary clinic was closed and he had to leave the bird outside the clinic. He checked on the bird’s progress the next day and was pleased when the vet said that the pigeon was better and had been set free.
</p>
<p>When asked about why they did this kind act, Ace Fong responded saying “It was the responsible thing to do.” He said that they could not bear the thought of the bird being helpless and injured.
</p>
<p>Speaking with the group made us reflect on how we could be kinder and more compassionate. It was truly admirable seeing their empathy towards the bird and their conviction in doing the right thing.
