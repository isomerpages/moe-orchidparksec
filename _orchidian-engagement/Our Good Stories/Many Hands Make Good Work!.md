<h3>Many Hands Make Good Work</h3>

<p>It turned out to be a not too mundane bus ride home for Xiang Yi on the evening of 25 February 2020 after all. As she climbed onto the seat in the bus, she saw a rather new bag sitting next to her. Puzzled as to who it belonged to, Xiang Yi peered in to find some art materials, Chinese Language assignments and a report book belonging to a Secondary 1 student from Northland Secondary. Instead of leaving the bag on the bus, she decided to take it with her, hoping she could somehow return it to its rightful owner. Xiang Yi contacted her form teacher that evening and was advised to bring it to school.</p>

<p>Back in school the next day, Xiang Yi brought up the issue of the lost-and-found bag in class and her classmate Aylaa’ offered to deliver the bag to Northland Secondary after school that afternoon as it was relatively near her home. Another classmate Aaliyah volunteered to accompany her. That afternoon, the 2 young girls played postwomen and brought the bag to Northland Secondary.</p>

<p>A week later, the school received a very pleasant surprise. The grateful student who had the bag returned to him wrote a letter of appreciation for the trio. Aylaa’ broke into tears when the letter was read to her. She shared that when she and Aaliyah returned bag to the General Office on 26 February, they did not leave their details as they did not think much of the act.</p>

<p>‘But I know we needed to bring it to Northland Secondary urgently as we know the student needs his art materials, and they are not cheap. So we went there after school and before our CCA started.’ Aylaa’ and Aaliyah offered. Xiang Yi added, ‘I am just happy for the student.’</p>

<p>We are certainly proud of you, young ladies!</p>
