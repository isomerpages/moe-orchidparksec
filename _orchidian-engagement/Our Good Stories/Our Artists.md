<p>Another wonderful piece of news to end the year! A few of our young artists’ submissions for&nbsp;<strong>National Day Pledge Card Design Competition</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Time Capsule of the Pledge Cards</strong>&nbsp;are on exhibition at the National Museum from National Day this year for a period of one year.</p>

<p>OPSS submitted 5 entries for this competition, out of which&nbsp;<strong>Chia Pei Xuan’s (Vanda-1)</strong>&nbsp;artwork was selected to be printed as the pledge card that came with this year’s National Day fun pack. Pei Xuan’s colourful and delightful entry expressed her vivid memories of visiting the Mama shop with her primary school friends.</p>

The Organising Committee ‘Art for Cause’ shared that they were very impressed with the quality of our students’ artwork. In fact, they requested for more submissions from us. Well done, Orchidians!  
Additionally, we are also pleased to showcase the other 3 pieces of artwork by&nbsp;<strong>Lee Jia Wen (Vanda-2)</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Clarice Tok Yi Jun (Vanda-6)</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Wong Shin Woon (Vanda-7)</strong>&nbsp;that had been shortlisted out of 2000 submissions national-wide.
