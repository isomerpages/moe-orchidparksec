<p>At Orchid Park Secondary School, we strive to develop Compassionate Leaders who make a positive impact on their community. Recently, one of our students demonstrated this vision in action through a simple yet meaningful gesture.</p>

<p>On 10 October 2024, after completing his examinations, Caleb Lim of class Vanda-5 was waiting at a bus stop with his friends. As his bus arrived, he noticed an elderly lady in her seventies struggling with a trolley. Without hesitation, Caleb sprang into action.</p>

<p>He swiftly helped the woman board the bus, lifting her trolley and assisting her to her seat. When asked about his actions, Caleb humbly replied, "It's no big deal."</p>

<p>While Caleb may have viewed his actions as routine, they likely meant a great deal to the elderly passenger. One can imagine the relief she felt, knowing that a kind young person was there to help her navigate what could have been a challenging situation.</p>

<p>Caleb's instinctive act of kindness embodies the values we aim to instill in all our students. It serves as a reminder that leadership often manifests in small, everyday actions that make a big difference to the lives of others.</p>

<p>We are proud of Caleb for exemplifying our school's vision of developing Compassionate Leaders. His actions demonstrate that even the simplest gestures can have a profound impact on those around us.</p>

<p>As we continue to nurture future leaders at Orchid Park Secondary School, we hope Caleb's story will inspire more of our students to look for opportunities to show kindness and compassion in their daily lives, truly embodying the spirit of a Compassionate Leader.</p>
