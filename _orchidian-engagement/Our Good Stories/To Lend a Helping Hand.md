<h4>To Lend a Helping Hand</h4>
	
<p>One of our Orchidians, Dorothy Lim from Orchis 4 was on her way back home from school after alighting from the train at Admiralty MRT station. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until she saw a middle-aged blind lady, calling out for help. 'Can someone help me? Can someone help me?' No one responded. This made her heart sink. There were so many people and yet not a single one decided to offer a helping hand.
</p>
<p>Without wasting any more time, Dorothy hurriedly made it through the crowd and approached her. Turned out that the lady just needed help to get off the platform, out of the MRT station and across the road to the bus-stop. Dorothy didn't have second thoughts and patiently guided the lady to her destination. She even waited at the bus-stop with her to make sure the lady boarded the right bus safely.
</p>
<p>In an interview with Dorothy, she mentioned that it was just her instinct that got her to perform the good deed and that being able to help someone in need makes her happy. She was also very humble, saying that she found no need to share the story with anyone as her only intent was to help the lady. This story is truly inspirational and sweet; our protagonist shows values such as compassion, humility and patience. We can all learn from this amazing act of kindness.
