<p>It was a scorching hot and humid Friday afternoon on 16 August 2019, when Irfaan and Mateen were on their way back to school for their CCA. While they were a short distance away from the school, they met a middle-aged ‘uncle’ struggling with his wheelchair. The ‘uncle’ asked the duo if they could help to wheel him back to his home, which was in the opposite direction from where they were headed to. Without hesitation, both agreed for they felt a wave of compassion for the ‘uncle’.</p>

<p>The detour resulted in the young gentlemen returning back to school 30 minutes later. But both were glad that they could be of help. They recounted how the ‘uncle’ offered them ice cold water, which they were very thankful for, at his home when he saw how both were thoroughly drenched with perspiration. However, this was what Irfaan and Mateen had to say, with a heart of empathy and love, ‘If we felt tired, then uncle would have felt worse, all alone in his wheelchair, under the hot sun.</p>

<p>Great job, boys! We are proud of you.</p>
