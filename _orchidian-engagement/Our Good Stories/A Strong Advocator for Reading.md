<h3>LIM QING JORDEAN KAUR (S3B2, 2019)</h3>

<div align="justify">
	
<p>It all started from a nomination by her Secondary One English teacher for Jordean to be a student-volunteer (reading buddy) in a reading programme in 2018. The programme involved Orchid Park Secondary School, Huamin Primary School, and the National Library Board (NLB). It is known as KidsREAD.</p>

<p>Since then, her enthusiasm in advocating the love for reading to others has been on the rise. That was further fuelled by her own passion in reading.</p>

<p>The reading programme requires two of our student-volunteers to read to the group of Primary One and Two students in each KidsREAD session. When Jordean was in the programme last year, her excitement in wanting to spread the love for reading was apparent as she would always volunteer herself to be one of the readers.</p>

<p>“I found KidsREAD meaningful as I could use my passion in storytelling to tell stories to the kids at Huamin Primary School. It also provided me the opportunity to learn how to teach children and keep them interested in the programme”, Jordean remarked. </p>

<p>The student-buddy of Huamin primary school whom Jordean was assigned to had also become rather attached to her as her buddy would look forward to attending the programme and seeing her each week.</p>

<p>“Hopefully, I have helped encourage them to develop a love for reading”, Jordean commented.</p> 

<p>Jordean’s drive to encourage others to develop and deepen their love for reading did not wane even when KidsREAD ended for her and her schoolmates at the end of last year. In fact, she has registered herself to be included in NLB’s mailing list, and has been encouraging her fellow schoolmates to participate in the reading activities organised by NLB. </p>

<p>“I want to continue to participate in NLB’s events as I feel it is a good opportunity to improve my language skills and broaden my knowledge about books”, Jordean said. </p>

<p>May her determination and perseverance in motivating others to pick up, sustain and enjoy reading inspire not only all Orchidians, but everyone else, to follow suit.</p>
