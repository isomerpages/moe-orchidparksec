<h4>About the CCA</h4>
<p>The Orchid Park Secondary School Floorball Girls&rsquo; team was formed back in 2010 and the Boys&rsquo; team was newly formed in 2017. Over the years, the Girls&rsquo; Floorball team has achieved great success in the National Schools Games (NSG) Floorball Championships, finishing top four in a few occasions.</p>
<p>Teamwork, sportsmanship, and an unwavering determination to achieve one&rsquo;s fullest potential are just some of the qualities that we hope to instill in our players. Through the sport, we also aim to develop a strong sense of camaraderie, friendship, and humility. Our players are always willing to strive for excellence, devoting time and energy to achieve their goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe strongly in the development of our student leaders. Potential leaders are given opportunities to display and develop their leadership skills, working independently or in teams, to fulfil the full potential of the team.</p>
