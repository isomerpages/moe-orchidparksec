<h4>Science Department</h4>
<h4>Department Mission</h4>
<p>I&nbsp;do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother&nbsp;pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ Isaac Newton</p>
<hr />
<p>Children often ask why, and that is the stepping stone in science education. In our school, we seek to encourage this natural curiosity and leverage on it in teaching the three sciences.</p>
<p>In the lower secondary syllabus, the students are exposed to all three disciplines. Subsequently, they are allowed to choose to pursue the pure sciences of their interest, if they are able to, at secondary three. The fundamental mission of our department is to impart a solid foundation in knowledge and content in the discipline. Another critical dimension is to provide a good practical grounding so that students are exposed to a variety of experiments and scientific equipment in their science lessons. The third and final imperative for science teachers, is to develop an inquiring mind set within our charges.</p>
<p>Our vision is of students who are not only well grounded in hard facts and practical skills but who think and continue to ask why.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Young Explorers&rsquo; Programme</h4>
<p>The Young Explorers programme (YEP) is a talent development programme organised for selected top-performing Science students in the Lower Secondary levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This programme aims to provide opportunities for these students to solve problems and share their ideas and reasoning with peers across classes, allowing them to nurture their curiosity and interest in Science as well as to deepen their scientific skills and knowledge through participating in a range of science-based challenges modelled after the Excellence 2K programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past two years, students in the YEP were invited to take part in Learning Journeys to the Singapore Bird Park, the NUS Science Demonstration Lab, and the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum.</p>
