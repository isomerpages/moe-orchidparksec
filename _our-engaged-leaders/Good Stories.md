<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stepping up</strong></span><br /><strong>Marysa (Secondary 3, Vanda-4, 2021)</strong></p>
<p>"Anytime you have an opportunity to do something good, just take it." This quote is from none other than our very own Marsya from Vanda 4.</p>
<p>Since primary school, Marsya has been the beneficiary of the Little Arts Academy and has since progressed to be part of 10 Square Youth, where she has majored in dance and theatre as part of her enrichment. When Marya first started dancing, she did it as she was passionate about it, and it brought her joy. But since then, she has discovered that dancing can bring joy to and benefit others. This realisation occurred when she saw herself in the news, and that was when the ball dropped. Marsya realised that by supporting and dancing for charitable organisations, she could raise funds for others so that they may benefit from programmes offered by philanthropic organisations just the way she had. That was when she understood the significance of her dancing.</p>
<p>Spurred on by this newfound sense of purpose, Marsya has continued to dance for charity. She has participated in several ChildAid events in KL, Jakarta and Singapore. ChildAid is Singapore's largest annual children's charity concert. It supports The Straits Times Pocket Money Fund and The Business Times Budding Artists Fund. The former pays for socially disadvantaged school-going children's meals and transport fees, while the latter supports financially underprivileged children's lessons in the performing arts. Apart from supporting the charities that have helped her, Marsya has also encouraged and inspired others to join her in fundraising events.</p>
<p>Marsya is undoubtedly a role model for us all. She has reminded us that we should not take things for granted and that no one is ever too young or too old to help someone else. She believes that no matter how small, our actions would always be seen and remembered by others.</p>
<p>Well said Marsya!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Helping Hand</strong></span><br /><strong>Tan Wei Bin (Secondary 3, Vanda-2, 2021)</strong></p>
<p>Many of us are often too involved in our own lives to notice what is happening around us. However, this was not true in the case of Tan Wei Bin from Vanda 2, whose thoughtful act caught the attention of two teachers.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 1st of July 2021, Orchid Park Secondary School&rsquo;s Tan Wei Bin, who was on his way home, caught sight of an elderly lady struggling to move a trolley stacked with a mountain of cardboard boxes. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Wei Bin approached the elderly lady to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>Even though the lady declined Wei Bin&rsquo;s offer at first, she eventually accepted his help. Wei Bin then followed the lady&rsquo;s instructions and moved the cardboard laden trolley across several roads and multiple void decks towards a lorry so that the cardboards could be placed there. Wei Bin even helped the elderly lady by loading the cardboard boxes onto the lorry and then continued to push the trolley while he walked the lady home. It is truly admirable that he was more than willing to spend nearly an hour helping a stranger.</p>
<p>When asked about why he had felt compelled to help in the first place, Wei Bin replied that he had thought of his grandmother when he decided to assist the elderly lady. He hoped that someone would extend a hand to his grandmother if she were ever in need, the same way he had to someone else in need.</p>
<p>Also, while walking the elderly lady home the journey, Wei Bin and the lady engaged themselves in conversations that triggered a series of thoughts in the former. One of which was, how can we take things for granted when others struggle for the same things? Wei Bin was disheartened to find out that the lady, despite her advanced age, was collecting boxes to earn enough to buy fish and meat for her meals. However, so many of us take for granted the many things our parents give us.</p>
<p>Speaking with Wei Bin was enlightening, and it lit a flame of inspiration within me. He truly believes that all of us should help those around us without expecting anything in return. And that we should help because we can.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Meet Jazel, Orchid Park&rsquo;s youngest author!</strong></span><br /><strong>JAZEL LAI XUAN YIN (Secondary 2, Orchis-5, 2020)</strong></p>
<p>Meet Orchid Park Secondary School&rsquo;s youngest ever author, Jazel Lai Xuan Yin from Orchis 5. In fact, she is the first student author we have in our history. At the age of 11, Jazel published her first book. The first of a duology, Fighting For Hope is an exciting teen fiction with a blend of action, mystery and romance. If that does not sound impressive, Jazel has recently completed the second book Fighting For Justice and is currently in the process of publishing it. Perhaps the most impressive thing of all is that she did everything mostly by herself.</p>
<p>Having published a book that is selling on websites like Amazon and Book Depository is certainly no easy feat for anyone, much less for a 13 year-old girl. Let&rsquo;s hear from the author herself on how she managed to do it.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: Hi Jazel. First of all, I must say I am very proud of your achievement, especially at such a young age. Can you briefly introduce your book, Fighting For Hope?</p>
<p>JAZEL: It begins with Hope Valentino, an eight year-old who witnessed the death of her biological father caused by Calvin Woodland, a multi-millionaire, and her mother. The grotesque death affected Hope greatly and at that moment, she swore to seek vengeance and never trust again. Ten years later, Hope becomes a young adult and she has yet to give up on her revenge. She learns how to fight and defend herself after enduring so much torment. The story follows her journey as she discovers how to trust and love someone again while finding the best way to seek justice for her father.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: I am curious, at the age of 11, what motivated you to write this book?</p>
<p>JAZEL: It was another story that pushed me to finally begin mine. A fictional action story drew me in. The main motivation was the thoughts and feelings I had after reading that book. I want my readers to feel the strong imagery of the fighting and the thrill that I felt.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: What are some difficulties you faced and how did you overcome them?</p>
<p>JAZEL: The entire process was difficult. It was like being in a completely foreign land. Nobody I associated with had the same interest as me but that didn&rsquo;t change the fact that I was a child with a big dream. Nobody thought it was possible for me to hold a book with my name on the cover, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me. I learnt everything from scratch. The actual writing of the story turned out to be the easiest part while the publishing was the most difficult. I had to figure out how to do it on my own. The process was tedious and time-consuming but the tenacity to continue and the thought of accomplishing my goal helped me to overcome these difficulties. I discovered that commitment is important, especially towards something I hope to achieve.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: Share with us your feelings when you finally published your book.</p>
<p>JAZEL: I felt a sense of satisfaction and a tiny hint of pride. Holding a physical copy of my book in my hands was a step beyond. It felt like a trophy, a piece of evidence to prove that as long as I put my heart and mind onto something, anything is possible.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: Last but not least, I heard that you are in the process of publishing your second book. Can you give a little sneak preview into your upcoming book?</p>
<p>JAZEL: My second book is called Fighting For Justice and this is the second part of the duology. I completed the book and it is currently going through the long process of publishing. It includes a character from the first book, and I gave him his own story. The next book I write will be of the fantasy genre.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: Thank you so much for your time and we look forward to your second book!</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A New Beginning</span><br /></strong><strong>CLARABEL LAI MAY YING (Secondary 1, Laelia-8, 2020)</strong></p>
<p>The school is very happy to share that Clarabel Lai May Ying of L8 has won a Merit Award for her participation in Live on Design Competition organised by National Organ Transplant Unit. We are touched by the conceptualisation of her artwork, and impressed with the care she puts in all details &ndash; big or small. Well done, Clarabel! Orchid Park is proud of you.</p>
<p>The theme of her artwork is &lsquo;A New Beginning&rsquo;, and the synopsis is as follows:</p>
<p>I drew the hands of the donor in grey, passing the heart to the hands of the recipient in beige to show splendour in living after receiving the new organ. The Gladioli symbolise hope, while the leaves bring calmness. I used the colours, tuscany yellow and spring green on the left, to show positivity and sense of renewal, while azure blue on the right to show sincerity from the family members of the donor. The Gladioli are drawn in a heart and an explosive formation to show that the donor can change and impact others' lives, and his or her heart can live on.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Many Hands Make Good Work!<br /></strong></span><strong>AALIYAH DELISHA BTE SIDEK (Secondary 2, Orchis-1, 2020)<br /></strong><strong>AYLAA' ARYNA BINTE JUMARDI (Secondary 2, Orchis-1, 2020)</strong><br /><strong>GAN XIANG YI (Secondary 2, Orchis-1, 2020)</strong></p>
<p>It turned out to be a not too mundane bus ride home for Xiang Yi on the evening of 25 February 2020 after all. As she climbed onto the seat in the bus, she saw a rather new bag sitting next to her. Puzzled as to who it belonged to, Xiang Yi peered in to find some art materials, Chinese Language assignments and a report book belonging to a Secondary 1 student from Northland Secondary. Instead of leaving the bag on the bus, she decided to take it with her, hoping she could somehow return it to its rightful owner. Xiang Yi contacted her form teacher that evening and was advised to bring it to school.</p>
<p>Back in school the next day, Xiang Yi brought up the issue of the lost-and-found bag in class and her classmate Aylaa&rsquo; offered to deliver the bag to Northland Secondary after school that afternoon as it was relatively near her home. Another classmate Aaliyah volunteered to accompany her. That afternoon, the 2 young girls played postwomen and brought the bag to Northland Secondary.</p>
<p>A week later, the school received a very pleasant surprise. The grateful student who had the bag returned to him wrote a letter of appreciation for the trio. Aylaa&rsquo; broke into tears when the letter was read to her. She shared that when she and Aaliyah returned bag to the General Office on 26 February, they did not leave their details as they did not think much of the act.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I know we needed to bring it to Northland Secondary urgently as we know the student needs his art materials, and they are not cheap. So we went there after school and before our CCA started.&rsquo; Aylaa&rsquo; and Aaliyah offered. Xiang Yi added, &lsquo;I am just happy for the student.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We are certainly proud of you, young ladies!</p>
