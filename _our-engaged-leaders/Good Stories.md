<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stepping up</strong></span><br /><strong>Marysa (Secondary 3, Vanda-4, 2021)</strong></p>
<p>"Anytime you have an opportunity to do something good, just take it." This quote is from none other than our very own Marsya from Vanda 4.</p>
<p>Since primary school, Marsya has been the beneficiary of the Little Arts Academy and has since progressed to be part of 10 Square Youth, where she has majored in dance and theatre as part of her enrichment. When Marya first started dancing, she did it as she was passionate about it, and it brought her joy. But since then, she has discovered that dancing can bring joy to and benefit others. This realisation occurred when she saw herself in the news, and that was when the ball dropped. Marsya realised that by supporting and dancing for charitable organisations, she could raise funds for others so that they may benefit from programmes offered by philanthropic organisations just the way she had. That was when she understood the significance of her dancing.</p>
<p>Spurred on by this newfound sense of purpose, Marsya has continued to dance for charity. She has participated in several ChildAid events in KL, Jakarta and Singapore. ChildAid is Singapore's largest annual children's charity concert. It supports The Straits Times Pocket Money Fund and The Business Times Budding Artists Fund. The former pays for socially disadvantaged school-going children's meals and transport fees, while the latter supports financially underprivileged children's lessons in the performing arts. Apart from supporting the charities that have helped her, Marsya has also encouraged and inspired others to join her in fundraising events.</p>
<p>Marsya is undoubtedly a role model for us all. She has reminded us that we should not take things for granted and that no one is ever too young or too old to help someone else. She believes that no matter how small, our actions would always be seen and remembered by others.</p>
<p>Well said Marsya!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Helping Hand</strong></span><br /><strong>Tan Wei Bin (Secondary 3, Vanda-2, 2021)</strong></p>
<p>Many of us are often too involved in our own lives to notice what is happening around us. However, this was not true in the case of Tan Wei Bin from Vanda 2, whose thoughtful act caught the attention of two teachers.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 1st of July 2021, Orchid Park Secondary School&rsquo;s Tan Wei Bin, who was on his way home, caught sight of an elderly lady struggling to move a trolley stacked with a mountain of cardboard boxes. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Wei Bin approached the elderly lady to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>Even though the lady declined Wei Bin&rsquo;s offer at first, she eventually accepted his help. Wei Bin then followed the lady&rsquo;s instructions and moved the cardboard laden trolley across several roads and multiple void decks towards a lorry so that the cardboards could be placed there. Wei Bin even helped the elderly lady by loading the cardboard boxes onto the lorry and then continued to push the trolley while he walked the lady home. It is truly admirable that he was more than willing to spend nearly an hour helping a stranger.</p>
<p>When asked about why he had felt compelled to help in the first place, Wei Bin replied that he had thought of his grandmother when he decided to assist the elderly lady. He hoped that someone would extend a hand to his grandmother if she were ever in need, the same way he had to someone else in need.</p>
<p>Also, while walking the elderly lady home the journey, Wei Bin and the lady engaged themselves in conversations that triggered a series of thoughts in the former. One of which was, how can we take things for granted when others struggle for the same things? Wei Bin was disheartened to find out that the lady, despite her advanced age, was collecting boxes to earn enough to buy fish and meat for her meals. However, so many of us take for granted the many things our parents give us.</p>
<p>Speaking with Wei Bin was enlightening, and it lit a flame of inspiration within me. He truly believes that all of us should help those around us without expecting anything in return. And that we should help because we can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another wonderful piece of news to end the year!

Pei Xuan&rsquo;s colourful and delightful entry expressed her vivid memories of visiting the Mama shop with her primary school friends.</p>
