<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Stepping up</strong></span><br /><strong>Marysa (Secondary 3, Vanda-4, 2021)</strong></p>
<p>"Anytime you have an opportunity to do something good, just take it." This quote is from none other than our very own Marsya from Vanda 4.</p>
<p>Since primary school, Marsya has been the beneficiary of the Little Arts Academy and has since progressed to be part of 10 Square Youth, where she has majored in dance and theatre as part of her enrichment. When Marya first started dancing, she did it as she was passionate about it, and it brought her joy. But since then, she has discovered that dancing can bring joy to and benefit others. This realisation occurred when she saw herself in the news, and that was when the ball dropped. Marsya realised that by supporting and dancing for charitable organisations, she could raise funds for others so that they may benefit from programmes offered by philanthropic organisations just the way she had. That was when she understood the significance of her dancing.</p>
<p>Spurred on by this newfound sense of purpose, Marsya has continued to dance for charity. She has participated in several ChildAid events in KL, Jakarta and Singapore. ChildAid is Singapore's largest annual children's charity concert. It supports The Straits Times Pocket Money Fund and The Business Times Budding Artists Fund. The former pays for socially disadvantaged school-going children's meals and transport fees, while the latter supports financially underprivileged children's lessons in the performing arts. Apart from supporting the charities that have helped her, Marsya has also encouraged and inspired others to join her in fundraising events.</p>
<p>Marsya is undoubtedly a role model for us all. She has reminded us that we should not take things for granted and that no one is ever too young or too old to help someone else. She believes that no matter how small, our actions would always be seen and remembered by others.</p>
<p>Well said Marsya!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Helping Hand</strong></span><br /><strong>Tan Wei Bin (Secondary 3, Vanda-2, 2021)</strong></p>
<p>Many of us are often too involved in our own lives to notice what is happening around us. However, this was not true in the case of Tan Wei Bin from Vanda 2, whose thoughtful act caught the attention of two teachers.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 1st of July 2021, Orchid Park Secondary School&rsquo;s Tan Wei Bin, who was on his way home, caught sight of an elderly lady struggling to move a trolley stacked with a mountain of cardboard boxes. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Wei Bin approached the elderly lady to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>Even though the lady declined Wei Bin&rsquo;s offer at first, she eventually accepted his help. Wei Bin then followed the lady&rsquo;s instructions and moved the cardboard laden trolley across several roads and multiple void decks towards a lorry so that the cardboards could be placed there. Wei Bin even helped the elderly lady by loading the cardboard boxes onto the lorry and then continued to push the trolley while he walked the lady home. It is truly admirable that he was more than willing to spend nearly an hour helping a stranger.</p>
<p>When asked about why he had felt compelled to help in the first place, Wei Bin replied that he had thought of his grandmother when he decided to assist the elderly lady. He hoped that someone would extend a hand to his grandmother if she were ever in need, the same way he had to someone else in need.</p>
<p>Also, while walking the elderly lady home the journey, Wei Bin and the lady engaged themselves in conversations that triggered a series of thoughts in the former. One of which was, how can we take things for granted when others struggle for the same things? Wei Bin was disheartened to find out that the lady, despite her advanced age, was collecting boxes to earn enough to buy fish and meat for her meals. However, so many of us take for granted the many things our parents give us.</p>
<p>Speaking with Wei Bin was enlightening, and it lit a flame of inspiration within me. He truly believes that all of us should help those around us without expecting anything in return. And that we should help because we can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another wonderful piece of news to end the year! A few of our young artists&rsquo; submissions for&nbsp;<strong>National Day Pledge Card Design Competition</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Time Capsule of the Pledge Cards</strong> are on exhibition at the National Museum from National Day this year for a period of one year.<br />OPSS submitted 5 entries for this competition, out of which&nbsp;<strong>Chia Pei Xuan&rsquo;s (Vanda-1)</strong>&nbsp;artwork was selected to be printed as the pledge card that came with this year&rsquo;s National Day fun pack. Pei Xuan&rsquo;s colourful and delightful entry expressed her vivid memories of visiting the Mama shop with her primary school friends.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Meet Jazel, Orchid Park&rsquo;s youngest author!</strong></span><br /><strong>JAZEL LAI XUAN YIN (Secondary 2, Orchis-5, 2020)</strong></p>
<p>Meet Orchid Park Secondary School&rsquo;s youngest ever author, Jazel Lai Xuan Yin from Orchis 5. In fact, she is the first student author we have in our history. At the age of 11, Jazel published her first book. The first of a duology, Fighting For Hope is an exciting teen fiction with a blend of action, mystery and romance. If that does not sound impressive, Jazel has recently completed the second book Fighting For Justice and is currently in the process of publishing it. Perhaps the most impressive thing of all is that she did everything mostly by herself.</p>
<p>Having published a book that is selling on websites like Amazon and Book Depository is certainly no easy feat for anyone, much less for a 13 year-old girl. Let&rsquo;s hear from the author herself on how she managed to do it.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: Hi Jazel. First of all, I must say I am very proud of your achievement, especially at such a young age. Can you briefly introduce your book, Fighting For Hope?</p>
<p>JAZEL: It begins with Hope Valentino, an eight year-old who witnessed the death of her biological father caused by Calvin Woodland, a multi-millionaire, and her mother. The grotesque death affected Hope greatly and at that moment, she swore to seek vengeance and never trust again. Ten years later, Hope becomes a young adult and she has yet to give up on her revenge. She learns how to fight and defend herself after enduring so much torment. The story follows her journey as she discovers how to trust and love someone again while finding the best way to seek justice for her father.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: I am curious, at the age of 11, what motivated you to write this book?</p>
<p>JAZEL: It was another story that pushed me to finally begin mine. A fictional action story drew me in. The main motivation was the thoughts and feelings I had after reading that book. I want my readers to feel the strong imagery of the fighting and the thrill that I felt.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: What are some difficulties you faced and how did you overcome them?</p>
<p>JAZEL: The entire process was difficult. It was like being in a completely foreign land. Nobody I associated with had the same interest as me but that didn&rsquo;t change the fact that I was a child with a big dream. Nobody thought it was possible for me to hold a book with my name on the cover, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me. I learnt everything from scratch. The actual writing of the story turned out to be the easiest part while the publishing was the most difficult. I had to figure out how to do it on my own. The process was tedious and time-consuming but the tenacity to continue and the thought of accomplishing my goal helped me to overcome these difficulties. I discovered that commitment is important, especially towards something I hope to achieve.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: Share with us your feelings when you finally published your book.</p>
<p>JAZEL: I felt a sense of satisfaction and a tiny hint of pride. Holding a physical copy of my book in my hands was a step beyond. It felt like a trophy, a piece of evidence to prove that as long as I put my heart and mind onto something, anything is possible.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: Last but not least, I heard that you are in the process of publishing your second book. Can you give a little sneak preview into your upcoming book?</p>
<p>JAZEL: My second book is called Fighting For Justice and this is the second part of the duology. I completed the book and it is currently going through the long process of publishing. It includes a character from the first book, and I gave him his own story. The next book I write will be of the fantasy genre.</p>
<p>MR KENNY: Thank you so much for your time and we look forward to your second book!</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A New Beginning</span><br /></strong><strong>CLARABEL LAI MAY YING (Secondary 1, Laelia-8, 2020)</strong></p>
<p>The school is very happy to share that Clarabel Lai May Ying of L8 has won a Merit Award for her participation in Live on Design Competition organised by National Organ Transplant Unit. We are touched by the conceptualisation of her artwork, and impressed with the care she puts in all details &ndash; big or small. Well done, Clarabel! Orchid Park is proud of you.</p>
<p>The theme of her artwork is &lsquo;A New Beginning&rsquo;, and the synopsis is as follows:</p>
<p>I drew the hands of the donor in grey, passing the heart to the hands of the recipient in beige to show splendour in living after receiving the new organ. The Gladioli symbolise hope, while the leaves bring calmness. I used the colours, tuscany yellow and spring green on the left, to show positivity and sense of renewal, while azure blue on the right to show sincerity from the family members of the donor. The Gladioli are drawn in a heart and an explosive formation to show that the donor can change and impact others' lives, and his or her heart can live on.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Many Hands Make Good Work!<br /></strong></span><strong>AALIYAH DELISHA BTE SIDEK (Secondary 2, Orchis-1, 2020)<br /></strong><strong>AYLAA' ARYNA BINTE JUMARDI (Secondary 2, Orchis-1, 2020)</strong><br /><strong>GAN XIANG YI (Secondary 2, Orchis-1, 2020)</strong></p>
<p>It turned out to be a not too mundane bus ride home for Xiang Yi on the evening of 25 February 2020 after all. As she climbed onto the seat in the bus, she saw a rather new bag sitting next to her. Puzzled as to who it belonged to, Xiang Yi peered in to find some art materials, Chinese Language assignments and a report book belonging to a Secondary 1 student from Northland Secondary. Instead of leaving the bag on the bus, she decided to take it with her, hoping she could somehow return it to its rightful owner. Xiang Yi contacted her form teacher that evening and was advised to bring it to school.</p>
<p>Back in school the next day, Xiang Yi brought up the issue of the lost-and-found bag in class and her classmate Aylaa&rsquo; offered to deliver the bag to Northland Secondary after school that afternoon as it was relatively near her home. Another classmate Aaliyah volunteered to accompany her. That afternoon, the 2 young girls played postwomen and brought the bag to Northland Secondary.</p>
<p>A week later, the school received a very pleasant surprise. The grateful student who had the bag returned to him wrote a letter of appreciation for the trio. Aylaa&rsquo; broke into tears when the letter was read to her. She shared that when she and Aaliyah returned bag to the General Office on 26 February, they did not leave their details as they did not think much of the act.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I know we needed to bring it to Northland Secondary urgently as we know the student needs his art materials, and they are not cheap. So we went there after school and before our CCA started.&rsquo; Aylaa&rsquo; and Aaliyah offered. Xiang Yi added, &lsquo;I am just happy for the student.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We are certainly proud of you, young ladies!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Deliveroo? Deliverbooks?<br /></strong></span><strong>ANSAREE SHAQUR BIN ZULKIFLEE (Secondary 2, Orchis-3, 2020)</strong></p>
<p>Ansaree was on his way home after his CCA one Friday evening (17 Jan 2020) when he picked up a box file lying on an empty seat in the public bus he was in. The file, packed to the brim with papers and notebooks looked like it belonged to a student. Ansaree guessed the owner could be from Orchid Park Secondary until he opened it to check. He was wrong &ndash; it belonged to a Secondary 1 student from Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary!</p>
<p>The considerate young gentleman abandoned his initial plan to bring the box file to Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary, a distance away from his home, as it was almost 7 pm in the evening. He reckoned the school would have been closed. Over the weekend, resourceful and quick-thinking Ansaree found an email contact in one of the notebooks and thought it could be the owner&rsquo;s email address. He did not want the young owner to be worried about the lost items, and so decided to send the supposed owner an email to assure her that he would deliver the box file to Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary the following Monday. However, there was no reply from the owner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Ansaree returned to school on Monday, he met his Vice-Principal and informed her about the incident. She shared that she would return the item to the school instead. Ansaree was more than happy about that! He imagined how anxious a new Secondary student would be. A few days later, a handwritten letter for Ansaree was delivered to Orchid Park Secondary from Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary. It was a letter of appreciation from the student whose box file Ansaree picked up. It read &hellip;..</p>
<img src="/images/gs10.jpg">
<p>Ansaree was almost touched to tears when the letter was handed to him.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; You made someone&rsquo;s day by just desiring to go the extra mile to look out for others.&nbsp; Well done, young man!</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feeling of Satisfaction &hellip; Glad to be of Help</span><br /></strong><strong>KENJI CHUA HAO JUN (S2A1, 2019)<br />MUHAMMAD HADITH BIN AJES (S2B2, 2019)</strong></p>
<p>It was an unexpected find for two good friends who were on their way home after a short meet-up on the evening of 24 September. Kenji and Hadith picked up a mobile phone just after leaving a food mall when they were headed to where their bicycles were parked.&nbsp;</p>
<img style="width: 55%;" src="/images/gs12.jpg" align = "left" />
<p>The 2 young boys unanimously agreed that they should send it to the nearest police station. When they got to&nbsp;Yishun North Police Station, and were waiting for their turn to lodge a report, the mobile phone rang! The gentleman on the line informed that he was a friend of the phone&rsquo;s owner, and he was calling on behalf of his friend who had lost the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that evening, the mobile phone was returned to its rightful owner at the police station, although the good deed resulted in the duo getting home much later. The owner was tremendously grateful to our young heroes, who did not think that what they had done was extraordinary. Nonetheless, both felt a great sense of satisfaction when they saw the joy in the owner&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;We followed our hearts and did what should be done. But it&rsquo;s surely a great feeling to be of help,&rdquo; Hadith mused. &ldquo;Yes! The feeling of satisfaction!&rdquo; added Kenji.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Right Thing to Do</span><br /></strong><strong>MUHAMMAD ANIQ BIN YUSOFF (S3C1, 2019)<br />ARASH MUHAMMAD BIN ABDUL RAHMAN (S3C1, 2019)</strong></p>
<p>When Aniq and Arash climbed onto their seats in a chartered bus, all ready and looking forward to an exciting SMRT learning journey, they found a mobile phone, not belonging to them. Almost instantly, both went up to their teacher, Mr Hendra, and handed the found item to him.</p>
<p>Mr Hendra and the boys reckoned that the mobile phone might have been left behind by someone who was on the bus earlier. Thankfully, there was no password to the mobile phone, and Mr Hendra was able to contact the &lsquo;owner&rsquo;. It turned out that a primary school pupil had left the mobile phone on the bus, without realising it. The lost item was returned to its rightful owner afternoon. The boy&rsquo;s parents were very touched and grateful to our 2 thoughtful and honest gentlemen. They wrote to the school to express their heartfelt appreciation.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;I am writing this email to express my thanks and gratitude to Mr Hendra and his 2 students, namely Arash &amp; Aniq from Sec 3C1, for taking the trouble to contact me and return my son&rsquo;s lost phone yesterday. </em></p>
<p><em>I would like to compliment them for their act of kindness and honesty, and I am sure that the school and Mr Hendra have instilled the right values in the students.&rsquo; </em></p>
<p>Both boys were also relieved and happy for the parents when the mobile phone was returned to them. They knew, right from the start, that returning the lost item was only the right thing to do. Arash shared, &lsquo;It is not my stuff, and I won&rsquo;t take it.&rsquo; Aniq added, &lsquo;Yes, and it would have cost the boy&rsquo;s parents quite a lot of money for the phone!&rsquo;</p>
<img style="width: 85%;" src="/images/gs13.jpg" align = "left" /><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>Well done, boys! You have indeed learnt our ORCHID values well, and have lived them out too!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All Ready to Help<br /></strong></span><strong>'ADLII IRFAAN BIN SHAIFULLAH (S2A2, 2019)<br /></strong><strong>ABDUL MATEEN BIN ASSARAFALI (S2A2, 2019)</strong></p>
<p>It was a scorching hot and humid Friday afternoon on 16 August 2019, when Irfaan and Mateen were on their way back to school for their CCA. While they were a short distance away from the school, they met a middle-aged &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; struggling with his wheelchair. The &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; asked the duo if they could help to wheel him back to his home, which was in the opposite direction from where they were headed to. Without hesitation, both agreed for they felt a wave of compassion for the &lsquo;uncle&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The detour resulted in the young gentlemen returning back to school 30 minutes later. But both were glad that they could be of help. They recounted how the &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; offered them ice cold water, which they were very thankful for, at his home when he saw how both were thoroughly drenched with perspiration. However, this was what Irfaan and Mateen had to say, with a heart of empathy and love, &lsquo;If we felt tired, then uncle would have felt worse, all alone in his wheelchair, under the hot sun.</p>
<img src="/images/gs14.png">
<p>Great job, boys! We are proud of you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Strong Advocator for Reading</span><br /></strong><strong>LIM QING JORDEAN KAUR (S3B2, 2019)</strong></p>
<p>It all started from a nomination by her Secondary One English teacher for Jordean to be a student-volunteer (reading buddy) in a reading programme in 2018. The programme involved Orchid Park Secondary School, Huamin Primary School, and the National Library Board (NLB). It is known as KidsREAD.</p>
<img style="width: 40%;" src="/images/gs15.png" align = "left" />
<p>Since then, her enthusiasm in advocating the love for reading to others has been on the rise. That was further fuelled by her own passion in reading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reading programme requires two of our student-volunteers to read to the group of Primary One and Two students in each KidsREAD session. When Jordean was in the programme last year, her excitement in wanting to spread the love for reading was apparent as she would always volunteer herself to be one of the readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found KidsREAD meaningful as I could use my passion in storytelling to tell stories to the kids at Huamin Primary School. It also provided me the opportunity to learn how to teach children and keep them interested in the programme&rdquo;, Jordean remarked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The student-buddy of Huamin primary school whom Jordean was assigned to had also become rather attached to her as her buddy would look forward to attending the programme and seeing her each week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopefully, I have helped encourage them to develop a love for reading&rdquo;, Jordean commented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordean&rsquo;s drive to encourage others to develop and deepen their love for reading did not wane even when KidsREAD ended for her and her schoolmates at the end of last year. In fact, she has registered herself to be included in NLB&rsquo;s mailing list, and has been encouraging her fellow schoolmates to participate in the reading activities organised by NLB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to continue to participate in NLB&rsquo;s events as I feel it is a good opportunity to improve my language skills and broaden my knowledge about books&rdquo;, Jordean said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May her determination and perseverance in motivating others to pick up, sustain and enjoy reading inspire not only all Orchidians, but everyone else, to follow suit.</p>
