<p><b>Collection of GCE O-Level Results</b><br>
OPSS students receiving their ‘O’ level results may report to the school hall from 1.30 pm onwards and be seated by 1.45 pm for the release of the results.</p>

<p>Please take note of the following:</p>

<p>1.	Students who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to school to collect their results.  They may appoint a proxy to collect the physical copy of their results from the school.<br>
2.	Students who are recovering from respiratory-related illnesses and are in school to collect their results should exercise social responsibility and wear a mask.<br>
3.	Students should be properly attired in either his/her school uniform or half-uniform for the collection of results.<br>

<p><b>2023 GCE O-Level Results Release: Supporting Your Teen</b><br>
The 2023 O-Level results will be released soon. Regardless of the outcome, it is important for our teens to know that they are loved for the person that they have grown up to be, and that their grades do not define who they are in our eyes. The social and emotional support you provide will be especially necessary and valuable in helping our teens manage their emotions and be positive when deciding their next steps.<br>
Do take this opportunity to have open conversations with your teen about his/her interests and choices and build his/her pathways together.</p>
