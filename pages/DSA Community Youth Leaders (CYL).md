<p>The Community OutReach Education (CORE) programme develops our *Community Youth Leaders (CYL) to be advocates for causes which they are passionate about. Driven by the school mission to develop students to be resourceful and confident individuals who are compassionate to their fellowmen, CORE works towards building student leadership, particularly through community engagement.</p>
<p>DSA CYL is not a CCA. All students enrolled through DSA CYL are expected to take up a CCA. They are expected to remain in the programme for DSA CYL throughout their secondary education with OPSS.</p>
<p>All students enrolled through DSA will lead their peers in cohort level service learning projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All successful DSA applicants are expected to <b>initiate</b> and champion at least one service-learning project that impacts the community, during their secondary education with OPSS.</p>
