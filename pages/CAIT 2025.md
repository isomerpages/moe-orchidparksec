<h4>Secondary Two Students Clinch First Runner-Up in IgnITE Skills Challenge 2025</h4>
	
<p>We are proud to celebrate the outstanding achievement of our Secondary Two students – Aisyah Nazirah Binte Muhammad Yazid, Mohammed Isqayyum Bin Mohammed Izzar, and Nur Al'Manda Afrina Binte Muhammad Arif from Orchis-1 – who emerged as First Runner-Up in this year’s IgnITE Skills Challenge.</p>
	
<p>The team impressed judges with their creative and sustainable water feature, constructed using repurposed PVC pipes and enhanced with water quality monitoring sensors. The challenge also called for students to think critically about sustainability, and our students rose to the occasion with an innovative and thoughtful design.</p>
	
<p>Throughout the competition, the trio demonstrated a commendable open-mindedness in learning how to use new tools and materials. Their resourcefulness shone through as they incorporated straws and syringes to build an effective prototype. Working collaboratively, they combined their ideas while showing mutual respect for each other’s creativity. Their resilience and adaptability were evident as they overcame design changes and optimised the use of available resources – all while staying true to their sustainability goals.</p>
	
<p>Congratulations to Aisyah, Isqayyum, and Al’Manda from Orchis-1 on this well-deserved achievement!</p>
